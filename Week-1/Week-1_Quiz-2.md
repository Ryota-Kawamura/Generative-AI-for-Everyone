**1.** A friend writes the following prompt to a web-based LLM: "Write a description of our new dog food product." Which of these are reasonable suggestions for how to improve this prompt?
- [ ] Give the LLM more context about what's interesting or unique about the product to help it craft a better description.
- [ ] Give it guidance on the purpose of the description (is it to go in an internal company memo, a website, a press release?) to help it use the right tone.
- [ ] Specify the desired length of the description.
- [x] All of the above.

**2.** Which of the following are tasks that LLMs can do? (Check all that apply)
- [x] Summarize articles.
- [ ] Earn a university degree (similar to a fresh college graduate).
- [x] Proofread text that you're writing.
- [x] Translate text between languages.

**3.** Someone prompts an LLM as follows: "Please summarize each of this morning's top 10 news stories in 100 words per story, in a manner suitable for a newsletter." What is the main reason this is unlikely to work?
- [ ] Asking for a list 10 items means we're working with structured date, which an LLM is poor at.
- [x] Because of the knowledge cutoff, the LLM will not have access to the latest news.
- [ ] The prompt needs to give more context about what type of newsletter it is (tech, general news, etc).
- [ ] The output length is limited, and 10 stories is too many.

**4.** You're preparing a presentation about technology, and ask an LLM to help you find an inspirational quote. It comes up with this:

`And that's what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it's the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with, and it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. -Steve Jobs`
How should you proceed?
- [ ] Do not use this quote because an LLM can generate toxic output.
- [ ] Because LLMs can hallucinate, double-check this quote by prompting the LLM to ask if it is really sure Steve Jobs said this.
- [ ] LLMs have learned from text on the internet; so you can safely trust that this quote is found on multiple webpages, and use it in your presentation.
- [x] Because LLMs hallucinate, double-check this quote by searching other sources (such as the web) to verify if Steve Jobs really said this.

**5.** You want an LLM to help check your writing for grammar and style. Which of these is the better approach for creating a prompt?
- [ ] Take all the time you need to carefully craft a prompt that gives it all the appropriate context, so that it works reliably the first time.
- [x] Don't overthink the initial prompt -- quickly give it some context, then prompt the LLM to get its response, see what you get and iteratively refine your prompt from there.
